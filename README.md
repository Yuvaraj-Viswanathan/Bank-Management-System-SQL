🏗 Technologies Used

MySQL 8+

SQL Functions

Stored Procedures

Triggers

Views

Relational Schema Design

ACID Transaction Concepts

🛢 Database Schema (Overview)
Tables

Customer → Customer details

Account → Savings/Current accounts

TransactionLog → Logs all operations

FraudAlerts → Stores suspicious events (trigger-based)

Relationships

One Customer → Many Accounts

One Account → Many Transactions

One Account → Many Fraud Alerts

⚙️ Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Create the database
CREATE DATABASE BankDB;
USE BankDB;

2️⃣ Run the schema
SOURCE schema.sql;

3️⃣ Add stored procedures
SOURCE stored_procedures.sql;

4️⃣ Add triggers
SOURCE triggers.sql;

5️⃣ Add reporting views
SOURCE views.sql;

6️⃣ Insert test data
SOURCE test_data.sql;

🧪 Sample Test Operations

Deposit
CALL DepositAmount(1, 20000);

Withdraw
CALL WithdrawAmount(1, 10000);

Transfer
CALL TransferAmount(2, 1, 50000);

🚨 Fraud Detection Example

If a withdrawal exceeds ₹50,000, the trigger automatically inserts an alert:

SELECT * FROM FraudAlerts;

📊 Reporting Views
1. Daily Transaction Summary
SELECT * FROM DailyTransactionReport;

2. High Value Customers (> ₹100,000)
SELECT * FROM HighValueCustomers;
